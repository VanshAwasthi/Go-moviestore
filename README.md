Go-MovieStore
To deploy and assess an API for the MovieStore project:

Environment Setup: Ensure that the MovieStore API's development environment is configured with necessary dependencies, required packages, and that the server is operational either locally or on a specified environment.

Endpoint Understanding: Familiarize yourself with the MovieStore API's endpoints and their functionalities (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) by referring to the API documentation or codebase. Identify the specific endpoint you intend to test.

API Testing Tool Usage: Employ an API testing tool such as Postman. Generate a new request by specifying the appropriate HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) and enter the MovieStore API endpoint URL.

Setting Request Parameters: Add the essential headers, parameters, or request body data based on the MovieStore API requirements. Include any authentication tokens or keys if necessary.

Initiate Request: Click "Send" in the API testing tool to trigger the request. Examine the response received from the MovieStore API, checking for status codes, headers, and the response body.

Response Inspection: Scrutinize the response data returned by the MovieStore API, ensuring alignment with expected behavior as per the API documentation or your application logic.

Debugging and Iteration: In case of issues, investigate server logs for errors. Make required adjustments to the request parameters or MovieStore API code. Repeat testing to validate correct functionality.

Testing Diverse Scenarios: Validate the MovieStore API's robustness by testing various inputs, exploring edge cases, and assessing error scenarios to ensure comprehensive handling.

Results Documentation: Document the outcomes of both successful and unsuccessful test cases, noting any bugs or encountered issues. Update documentation for future reference or debugging purposes.

Collaboration and Review: Share your findings with team members to facilitate collaboration, review, and refinement of the MovieStore API's behavior and overall functionality.

For building the project, utilize go build, and for running it, execute go run main.go.
